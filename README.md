# FM-PLM-UX-Extensions

Minimal demo scaffold added to help compile and run a React/Vite demo of the Project Intake component.

How to run locally:

1. Install dependencies:

	npm install

2. Start the dev server:

	npm run dev

Open the dev server URL shown in the terminal (Vite default: http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- This workspace includes a compact demo `src/App.jsx` and `src/main.jsx` to make the project buildable.
- The original large App component was trimmed to a minimal working example; we can progressively restore features.
